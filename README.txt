This is our fullstack Banking web application that we created for our project 2. It consists of landing, register, login, accounts, and settings pages. User stories include being able to register a new user, login a user, create a new account, view accounts, filter accounts by type, edit user settings, track income and expenses, and transfer money between accounts. It utilizes Spring Framework, React, Maven, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CCS, JUnit, Mockito, PostgreSQL, DBeaver, Postman, and AWS RDS. Additional software prerequisites for this program include installing the following React packages via the Node Package Manager: react-router-dom, react-redux, redux, @types/react-router-dom, axios, @reduxjs/toolkit. As well as the following dependencies added to the pom.xml in IntelliJ: Spring Boot Actuator, Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot Dev Tools, PostgreSQL, JUnit, and Mockito. Environment variables for the project involve setting  React to use localhost: 3000, and Spring to use localhost: 5000.
